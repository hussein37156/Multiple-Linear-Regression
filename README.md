In this project, I implemented vector calculus to optimize a parameter vector (1x3) for performing multiple linear regression.

**Notes:**
  The equation's bias term is included in the parameter vector, with its weight set to 1 (this is reflected in the dataset as an additional column).
  The necessary equations are derived step by step for easier generalization to a (1xn) parameter vector.
